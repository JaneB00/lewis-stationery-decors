Lewis Stationery has established a robust presence in the office supplies industry, offering a diverse range of products from office essentials to maintenance and housekeeping equipment across numerous cities in the USA. In my role as a data analyst, I was tasked with dissecting various facets of the business’s performance, focusing on revenue patterns, sales volumes, and product popularity to unearth actionable insights.

**Objective**
The core aim was to delve deep into historical data to extract a clear picture of the business's trajectory, providing Lewis with the necessary information to refine operational and strategic decisions.
